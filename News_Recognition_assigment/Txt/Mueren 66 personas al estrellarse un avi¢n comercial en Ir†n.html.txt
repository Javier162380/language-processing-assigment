A commercial plane with 60 passengers on board, including a child, and six crew members crashed in the region of Samirom, in the central province of Isfahn. The airline responsible for the flight has confirmed the death of the 66 people who traveled on board the aircraft.
Official sources indicated that the plane disappeared from the radar about 20 minutes after having taken off from the Tehern airport to the city of Yasuy (southwest).
In the area of ​​the incident, the authorities have sent helicopters because it is difficult to access ambulances because it is a mountainous region, added Khaled.
The device is a twenty-five year old ATR 72-500 from the Iranian Aseman airline.
Irn has an obsolete area fleet due to years of international sanctions and in the last decade there have been several serious accidents.
The last one took place in August 2014 in Tehern, in which 40 people died. Three years earlier, another commercial plane crashed during a snowstorm in northern Irn, killing 77 people.
